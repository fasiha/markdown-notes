# markdown-notes

This is a collection of simple JavaScript scripts for a very customized note-taking workflow that I use. It is not anticipated to be any good to anyone else—although, I hope one day to write an “Introduction to Express.js” using `server.js`.

# Requirements

Install https://github.com/github/cmark/

Then `yarn` (or `npm install`) to install Node dependencies.

Then `mkdir content` or `git clone YOUR_SECRET_CONTENT_REPO content`!
